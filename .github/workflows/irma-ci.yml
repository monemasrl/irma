# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master, development, testing]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master, development, testing]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  python-tests:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10.5"]
    runs-on: self-hosted

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
